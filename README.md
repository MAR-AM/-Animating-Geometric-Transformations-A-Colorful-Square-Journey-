# -Animating-Geometric-Transformations-A-Colorful-Square-Journey-
This HTML and CSS code creates a captivating animation by applying keyframe transformations to a square div element.
The div (id="objet") undergoes a series of changes in size, position, rotation, and color, creating a visually dynamic effect. The animation, named monanimation, is set to run infinitely with a duration of 2 seconds per iteration. The keyframes define various states of the square, transitioning from its original state to rotated positions with changing background colors. The result is a mesmerizing display where the square smoothly transforms, creating a vibrant and engaging visual experience. This code serves as a demonstration of how CSS animations and keyframes can be utilized to bring dynamic and interactive elements to a webpage.
